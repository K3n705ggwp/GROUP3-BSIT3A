        The rapid growth of e-commerce has fundamentally altered how customers shop, making online shopping an essential component of the retail industry. However, this change has made logistics and delivery handling more difficult, particularly for working professionals and students with hectic schedules. When deliveries cannot be made to the specified address, logistics companies frequently receive returned parcels, canceled orders, and face excessive expenses. These issues not only increase expenses for logistics firms but also cause inconvenience for recipients and delivery riders. Moreover, repeated failed delivery attempts reduce customer trust and satisfaction, which are crucial for online shopping and affect the overall efficiency and reliability of the supply chain.
                           
        To address these issues, innovative solutions must be developed that can ensure parcel security and convenience while also being efficient. Parcel lockers and lockbox systems have evolved into practical solutions to consumers' increased desire for convenience, as well as the logistical issues that transportation companies confront. In response to these requirements, this study suggests the creation of a Parcel Lockbox with a Centralized Management System that is adapted to the demands of Filipino customers and logistics workers.
  
        This system includes advanced features such as PIN-based access, automated payment for cash-on-delivery transactions, and delivery verification using image processing with an ESP32 camera and Edge Impulse. Additionally, the centralized management platform allows landlords, business managers, and school administrators to easily manage rented compartments and monitor parcel deliveries.
    This study focuses on both the technical and operational aspects of last-mile logistics by enhancing parcel delivery security, automation, and accessibility. It has the potential to benefit a wide range of stakeholders, including consumers, delivery professionals, logistics companies, landlords, and policymakers, by creating a more structured, secure, and user-friendly delivery environment.

Ultimately, the goal of this study is to improve the e-commerce delivery environment in the Philippines by designing a cost-effective, scalable, and smart lockbox system that meets current logistics needs while anticipating future demands.
